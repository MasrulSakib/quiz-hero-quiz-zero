                    <br>
                    <p class="text-xl">Answer: <br>
                        map: Transforms each element of an array and returns a new array with the same length.
                        forEach: Executes a provided function on each array element, but doesn't modify the array or
                        return a new one.
                        filter: Creates a new array containing elements that pass a provided condition.
                        find: Returns the first array element that satisfies a condition, or undefined if none do.

                    <br>
                    <p class="text-xl">Answer: <br>
                        Local Storage: It's a web storage mechanism that allows websites to store data as key-value
                        pairs in a user's web browser. The data persists even after the browser is closed and can be
                        accessed on subsequent visits to the same website. Local storage provides more storage space
                        compared to cookies but is limited to the specific domain.

                        Session Storage: Similar to local storage, session storage also stores data as key-value pairs
                        in a user's browser. However, the data is only available for the duration of the browser
                        session. Once the user closes the browser or tab, the session storage data is cleared.

                        Cookies: Cookies are small pieces of data stored in a user's browser by websites. They are often
                        used to store user-specific information like login sessions, preferences, and tracking data.
                        Cookies have an expiration date and can be set to persist across browser sessions. They have
                        size limitations compared to local storage and session storage.

                        All three mechanisms are used for client-side data storage but serve different purposes and have
                        varying capabilities and limitations.

                    <h3>3. How Eventloop works in Javascript/ES6?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-xl">Answer: <br>
                        The event loop in JavaScript manages the order of execution for asynchronous tasks. It maintains
                        a call stack for function execution, a callback queue for completed tasks, and utilizes
                        microtasks (like promises) to prioritize certain tasks. This enables non-blocking behavior,
                        efficient handling of I/O operations, and ensures responsive web applications.
